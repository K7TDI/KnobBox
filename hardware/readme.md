Here is the hardware.  TLDR is at the bottom.

I designed it in Eagle (pretty poorly) using the default libraries plus the Sparkfun and Adafruit libraries.  You can find them below.  I also made a custom library with some different pad sizes and shapes to make it easier to make the board.  If you use Eagle to make PCBs at home, I highly reccomend modifying the pads, especially the inside drill diameter.  Since you're drilling them out with whatever bit size you want anyway, you might as well leave more metal there and have a small dimple in the middle, which makes it way easier to square up the drill bit.

This is exactly what I used, so if you replicate it, it should work.  However, it can be improved, and when I have time I'll put up some new files with ideas for improvements I came up with while assembling it.  I'm sure someone more experienced could also do a complete overhaul on this and make it way better.  I've included some of my issues and ideas in the Issues file.


*TLDR: The eagle files use the SparkFun, Adafruit, and my libraries.  If you recreate this, it should work.  The Issues file has things I ran into while making and assembling it.*
