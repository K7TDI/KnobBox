Here are the Eagle files for the KnobBox.  You'll also find my Eagle library here.  Go back and read the readme in the Hardware folder if you haven't yet.

About making the board:


I successfully made this using the toner transfer method with a Brother laser printer, HP photo paper, and Radio Shack etchant solution.  I haven't tried using any other printer, but at least with this combo, after printing I need to put the photo paper in a sealed container containing a little bit of acetone (not touching the paper) for about half an hour before I iron the paper onto the PCB.

I'm still getting the hang of all of it, so I tried to keep the traces as wide and widely spaced as possible.  I'm fairly sure these files are not within spec for production by a board house, but I'm sure it wouldn't be too hard to fix, and some awesome improvements in routing could be made with closer spaced traces and a ground plane.
