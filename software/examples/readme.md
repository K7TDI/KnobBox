Here are some example files that show what the hardware can do.  I've commented as much as possible in the code, although I make no promises that my thought process makes sense.

These make use of the LiquidCrystal library included with the Arduino IDE, and the Encoder library from PJRC, which is by far the best I've found.  That's available here:
